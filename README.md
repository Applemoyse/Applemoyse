<h1 align="center">👋 Hi! I'm Applemoyse, 🥧🍎 creator of LUNA 🐱‍💻</h1>

- 🔭 Currently, I'm focused on creating my own projects and becoming an active contributor to open source projects.
- 💻 My expertise lies in web development technologies.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm the proud owner of a delightful white cat named Luna. I couldn't resist naming her after the moon and the iconic character from Sailor Moon. Yes, it might be a tad cliché, but Luna has become my ultimate muse and trusted familiar. She brings a touch of magical inspiration to my coding adventures!

## 💞️ Projects
Throughout my journey as a developer, I have worked on various projects, including:

- [LUNA: A Discord Bot ](https://luna-catbot.netlify.app): Built on JavaScript, LUNA comes packed with an array of features and leverages various APIs to enhance your server experience. With a collection of around 10 commands already at disposal, LUNA is ready to bring some fun and functionality to a Discord community. Whether you need moderation tools, or even just a bit of entertainment, LUNA has got it covered.
- [Arcane Twenty-Seven](https://novmaryllis.quest): A gaming hub that takes you on a nostalgia trip to the Geocities era. A CSS-powered website, which pays homage to the aesthetics of the past while providing a modern and interactive experience.
